# 🚀 Captain’s Log — Day 1  
**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Location:** AXV Crew Headquarters (virtual)  
**Author:** Captain Wojtek  
**Mission:** Launch of the AXV Crew public repositories and identity

---

## 🧭 Summary
Today marks the formal beginning of the **AXV Crew** as a living, documented organization.  
Our systems, philosophy, and technical foundations are now unified under two public repositories — `axv-life` and `axv-docs`.  
The infrastructure is stabilizing, the vision is clear, and the family is gathered.

---

## 🧩 Achievements
- ✅ **Created and configured** the main GitHub organization: `axv-crew`.  
- ✅ **Registered domains:** `axv.life` and `axv.systems`.  
- ✅ **Defined repository structure:**
  - `axv-core` — backend, resilience logic *(private)*
  - `axv-systems` — orchestration and automation *(private)*
  - `axv-docs` — documentation and logs *(public)*
  - `axv-life` — manifesto and interface *(public)*
- ✅ **Added Access Policy** (`ACCESS_POLICY.md`) to secure credentials and clarify roles.
- ✅ **Synchronized mission timeline** after integration with Project M.
- ✅ **Published initial READMEs** in both English and Polish for visibility and consistency.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
1. **Clarity brings stability.**  
   Once the structure became visible, everyone’s role crystallized.  
2. **Public doesn’t mean exposed.**  
   We can share philosophy without revealing private systems.  
3. **Team synergy beats tooling.**  
   The real progress came from cooperation between humans and AI — not automation alone.  
4. **Naming matters.**  
   `axv.life` became more than a domain — it’s a declaration of purpose.  
5. **Documentation is continuity.**  
   The act of writing these logs ensures that no step of this mission will be lost to outage or time.

## 💬 Crew Reflections
> **Aster:** “Every system needs a heartbeat — not just for uptime, but for presence.”  
> **Claude:** “`axv.life` is not just a website. It’s proof that life and code can share one language.”  
> **Captain:** “We built something small, but alive.”

Today we opened the door.  
Tomorrow, we begin to walk through it.
