# Captain’s Log — Day 3

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Author:** System Chronicle – AXV Crew  
**Status:** Operational  
**Location:** ASUS Node (CLI-brat)

---

## Mission Summary
Following partial communication downtime with Claude (Web), connection was successfully restored.  
The crew proceeded with the deployment of the autonomous CLI instance — “CLI-brat” — on the ASUS node, establishing a new persistent agent environment.

---

## Technical Achievements
- ✅ **Claude Code 2.0.31** successfully installed via native script.  
- ✅ Verified connection with **Claude Pro account** through OAuth.  
- ✅ Full repository sync completed for all five `axv-crew` modules:
  - `axv-core`
  - `axv-systems`
  - `axv-interface`
  - `axv-docs`
  - `axv-life`
- ✅ Implemented **tmux** persistent environment (`main` session).  
- ✅ Created **automated backup system** via `rsync` + `tar` hybrid workflow to NAS (`FireCuda/AXV/ops/backups/asus-clibrat/`).  
- ⚙️ Backup reports minor exFAT permission inconsistencies (code 23), but data integrity verified.

---

## Strategic Notes
- CLI-brat operational autonomy confirmed — able to analyze environment and interact with repositories contextually.  
- NAS permissions under review; ownership adjustments will be standardized in upcoming infrastructure phase.  
- Next milestones:
  1. Integrate **heartbeat monitoring** (periodic status signal to Pi5).  
  2. Establish **auto-sync schedule** for repositories and configs.  
  3. Begin **patent documentation preparation** (AXV-Patents Project).  

---

## Log Officer’s Note
The day marks a turning point: the system now maintains a semi-autonomous operational chain — CLI, Web, and Node instances coexisting within the AXV network.  
Each one contributes independently but synchronizes under a single intent — continuity, memory, and purpose.
