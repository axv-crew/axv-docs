# AXV Digital Safety Net (DSN)

**Status:** Discovery (v0.2)  
**Owner:** Aster × Voytek (AXV)

The **AXV Digital Safety Net** is an opt-in, privacy-preserving safety framework designed to detect severe emotional crisis indicators within AI-mediated conversations.  
It does **not** diagnose or intervene directly. Instead, DSN enables a user-approved escalation to a **trusted contact** when high-risk patterns appear consistently.

---

## 🔍 Purpose
Many individuals do not reach out to hotlines or family members during crisis moments — but they *do* communicate through chat systems.  
DSN aims to provide a **consensual safety layer** that bridges AI interaction and real human support.
